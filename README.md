ACF Wizard
==========

Build a First-Run-Wizard with ACF.

The **'Wizard Step** field organizes Your fields in Steps to pace through â€“ Just like Tabs, just as a Wizard. 

Use conditional logic to prevent a step from being navigatable.

Use the **Wizard Proceed** field to navigate through the steps.

The **User Dashboard** location replaces the default WordPress Welcome screen.  
By default the Welcome screen is not dismissible any more. Making make it dismissible again is a one-liner:

```php
add_filter( 'acf_wizard_welcome_dismissable', '__return_true' );
```
